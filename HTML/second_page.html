			The Taj Mahal is called as â€‰'Crown of the Palace'.It is an ivory-white marble mausoleum
 on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.Construction of the mausoleum was essentially
 completed in 1643,but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex
 is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653  at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million 
rupees,which in 2021 would be approximately 70 billion rupees.
